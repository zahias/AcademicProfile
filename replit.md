# Overview

This is a research profile platform that creates beautiful, automatically-updated academic profiles powered by the OpenAlex API. The application allows researchers to showcase their publications, impact metrics, research topics, affiliations, and academic journey in a unified dashboard. It features authentication, profile management, data synchronization with OpenAlex, and public profile viewing capabilities.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens and CSS variables
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

## Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with type-safe database operations
- **API Design**: RESTful API endpoints with Express route handlers
- **File Uploads**: Uppy.js with support for AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage

- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema generation
- **Tables**: 
  - Users and sessions for authentication
  - Researcher profiles with OpenAlex integration
  - Cached OpenAlex data (publications, topics, affiliations)
  - Research topics, publications, and institutional affiliations

## Authentication & Authorization
- **Provider**: Replit OIDC authentication with Passport.js
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions with connect-pg-simple
- **Authorization**: Route-level authentication middleware
- **User Management**: Automatic user creation and profile linking

## Data Integration
- **OpenAlex API**: Service layer for fetching researcher data, publications, and academic metrics
- **Data Caching**: Local database caching of OpenAlex data with sync timestamps

## Project Structure
- **Monorepo**: Shared types and schemas between client and server
- **Client**: React SPA in `/client` directory
- **Server**: Express API in `/server` directory  
- **Shared**: Common schemas and types in `/shared` directory
- **Build**: Separate build processes for client (Vite) and server (esbuild)

# Environment Variables

## Required Environment Variables
- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection string for Neon database
- **ADMIN_API_TOKEN**: Bearer token for admin endpoint authentication (high entropy random string)

## Optional Environment Variables
